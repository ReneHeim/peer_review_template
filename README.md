### :compass: Ethical and practical guidelines for reviewers

When using this template, please keep in mind the following principles:

1. **Anonymity**  
   Follow the journal’s peer review model and policy. Decide whether to sign your review or remain anonymous, and respect any double‑blind procedures in place.

2. **Constructiveness**  
   Aim to help the authors improve their work. Focus on clarity, rigor, and usefulness of your comments rather than on the authors themselves.

3. **Evidence‑based evaluation**  
   Ground your assessments and recommendations in specific parts of the manuscript and, where relevant, in the scholarly literature.

4. **Transparency and openness**  
   Disclose any potential conflicts of interest or biases, and support open and reproducible research practices where possible (e.g. data and code availability).
